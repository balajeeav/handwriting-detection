# handwriting-detection
This machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. 
This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

Project Prerequisites--

Below are the prerequisites for this project:

>Python (3.7.4 used)   |
>IDE (Jupyter used)

Required frameworks are

>Numpy (version 1.16.5) |
>cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2) |
>Keras (version 2.3.1) |
>Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0) |
>Matplotlib (version 3.1.1) |
>Pandas (version 0.25.1) |
